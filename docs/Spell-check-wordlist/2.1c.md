In this video we learnt to use one of the Spell Check features which is only available in the Wordlist window.
### Open the Worlist
-   Open the menu for the project.
-   Under Tools, click **Wordlist**.  
    *The Wordlist window opens for this project*.
-   Open the menu for this window.
-   Under Tools, hover over **Spell Check** to view the submenu.  
    *There are 6 special spell checks listed here, or you can run them all at once*.

### To use the Common Typos
-   Click **Common Typos**.  
    *The Wordlist enters a Spell Check mode showing probable Common Typos*.

Paratext lists words containing a pattern of letters that was **previously corrected in other words**, along with a suggested respelling.
-   Click on a suggestion.  
    *Paratext opens the Replace dialog which shows each occurrence of the misspelled word and checks we want to replace it*.
-   Click ‘**Yes’** or ‘**Yes to all**’ to make the replacement.

### To return to normal mode in the Wordlist window
-   Click the blue command link
    **Close Spell check (Common Typos) and show all words**.  
    *This switches off the Common Typos spell check*.test
