title:  Chorus Hub (4.2)

Translation teams that do not have a good internet connection but sometimes work in the same office can still use Send/Receive to collaborate on a project by using ChorusHub. It uses a local area network.

#### Set up Chorus Hub

-   Just **one** team member downloads and installs Chorus Hub.

    Once installed, the Chorus Hub service runs in the background.

#### Send/receive to Chorus Hub

-   Click Paratext menu, then **Send/receive**
-   Choose **Chorus Hub**.
-   Click **Send/receive** button.

    Paratext does a send/receive to the local network.

#### Send/Receive to Internet

It is also important to do a Send/Receive to the internet occasionally.

Chorus Hub Send/Receive only makes a copy on the local network; it does not automatically go to the Internet server.
