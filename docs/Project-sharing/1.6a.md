### What is a Conflict
A conflict occurs when two or more people edit the text at the same time. Paratext gets confused and does not know which one to keep. It chooses one and adds a conflict note.

It is best to have only one translator edit a text at time. Other team members should add notes of their suggestions (see later videos on notes).
