## Other ways of opening the find dialog

It’s helpful if the window you want to search in is active first.

-  **Restrictions**
   -   **No restriction** means matches can be any part of a word or a whole word.
   -   **whole word only**,
   -   at the **beginning of the word** or
   -   at the **end of the word** or  
- **Match Case**–match whether the characters are uppercase or lowercase.  
- **Show Verse Context** means the list shows the matching word or string, with some adjacent words in the verse as well.

## Replace

There are three ways of opening the Replace tab

-   From the Find/Replace dialog – click the **Replace** tab
-   **Ctrl-H** the keyboard shortcut.
-   **Menu** \> **Edit** \> **Replace**.
-   Open the Find and Replace dialog.
-   Change the text in the **Find** box if needed.
-   Type the text you want to replace it with in the **Replace with** box.
-   Click **Replace** button.  
    *Instead of showing you a list of matches, Paratext opens the Replace dialog and shows you one match at a time*.

## Replacing matches

-   **Yes** or **No** approve each change individually.
-   **Yes to all** will approve all the remaining proposed changes, so this needs to be **used with care**.  
    *Make absolutely sure it is a change you want to make everywhere (e.g. review with Find first)*.
-   If you want to stop the process completely, click **Cancel**.  
    *Please note, any changes you have already clicked Yes for will not be cancelled*.
    *Paratext will inform you how many matches were not changed because you did not have the permission to edit them*.
:::note
Find and Replace Yes to all only makes changes in places you have permission to edit.
