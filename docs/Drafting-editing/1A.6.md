title: Book Introductions (1A.6)
---
Many translation projects add introductions to each book of the Bible. In this video, I will show you how to make a basic book introduction that will be adequate for most projects.

The **book introduction** is considered **everything between** **the book title** and the **chapter one marker**.

All of the markers used in book introductions begin with a lowercase letter “**i**”. You can read about the markers in the USFM User Reference that is available on the Paratext website.

### Paragraph markers

- **Headings**: \\imt or \\is
- **Paragraphs**: \\ip

[See the Paratext manual for more markers] ../../Training-Manual/08-Appendix/C.USFM.md)

### Introduction Outline

- Title: **\\iot** or Introduction Outline Title marker.
- Level 1: **\\io1** or Introduction Outline level 1 marker.
- Other levels: **: \\io2** or **\\io3** and so forth

### Introduction Outline Reference

- **\\ior** (Introduction Outline Reference marker).
- **\\xt** (Cross Reference - Target Reference marker) in the body of the text
:::tip
Adding the \\xt ... \\xt*  around references allows Paratext to check such references for errors.

### Word level markers

- **\\bk** Book Name marker  
- **\\qt** Quoted text marker
