title: Adding Paragraphs (1.3c)
---
:::info
This video was created in Paratext 8 but applies equally to Paratext 9. In this video we learn there are a few places where you must insert a paragraph marker.
:::

At a minimum, Paratext needs a paragraph at the beginning of each chapter.

In **standard view**

-   Click where you want to put the paragraph,
-   press **ENTER**, and then select the paragraph marker from the list.

### Add after section headings markers

\\s1, \\s2, \\s3 \\s4

Be sure to add another paragraph marker after the heading.

### Add after Parallel reference headings

\\r 

Be sure to add another paragraph marker after the reference heading.

:::tip
Remember,
-   you **always** need a paragraph marker **before verse 1** of any chapter.
-   you **always** need a paragraph **after** any **section head \\s...** or **parallel passage heading \\r**.
:::

### Other common markers

-   \\p standard paragraph
-   \\m for a paragraph with no first line indent,
-   \\nb paragraph with no break with the previous paragraph
-   \\pi where all the paragraph is indented,
-   \\q1 or \\q2 for indented quotes or poetry.
