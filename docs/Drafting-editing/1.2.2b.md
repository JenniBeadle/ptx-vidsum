title: How to work with USFMs  in Formatted View (1.2.2b)
---
In this video we changed to Formatted view and learnt about adding and removing USFM styles here.

The view options are available on the menu for the project.

-   Click the **≡** menu icon on the project’s title bar.
-   Expand the menu if necessary ˅.  
    *The option with the checkmark or tick is the currently selected view*.
-   Click **Formatted**.  
    *The view changes and the USFM tags are hidden*.

### Entering character markers

-   Press \\ backslash  
    *The character marker menu just as in Standard view*.

### Entering paragraph breaks

-   Press **ENTER**  
    *A new **normal paragraph** is inserted*.

### Using style chooser on the toolbar

In both Standard and Formatted views the marker which applies to the text is shown in the Style chooser on the toolbar.

-   Select the text
-   Click the chooser.  
    *The most commonly occurring markers are shown at the top*.
-   Select a marker
>   If you select a *paragraph* style, it will be applied to the *entire* paragraph.
>   If you select a *character* style will be applied to the *selected text*.

### Removing an unwanted character style.

-   Select the text
-   On the Style chooser select **Clear formatting**.  
    *The text goes back to normal and behind the scenes the USFM tags have been removed*.
