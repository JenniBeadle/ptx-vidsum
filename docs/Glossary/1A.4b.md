---
Like editing other books in Paratext, it is necessary for a user to have the relevant task assignments or user permissions in order to add renderings to the glossary or to edit the glossary book directly.

### Can you type in the citation form?

-   Does the Titlebar of Edit Renderings dialog box says “**Not Editable**”

### Contact your administrator

-   Your administrator can give you the necessary permission if appropriate.
