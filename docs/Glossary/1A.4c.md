title: Finding/Linking Entries (1A.4c)
---
There are three ways to find out if a term already has an entry in the glossary or not.

### Filter for “Glossary Entries”

-   Change the filter from “All terms” to “Glossary Entries”.

Paratext will now only list the Biblical terms that do have a glossary entry.

### An asterisk = it has glossary entry for the current term.

-   No asterisk = no glossary entry linked
-   Click on the Glossary tab.
-   Click the dropdown arrow at the end of the citation form box.

    A list of all the citation forms in the Glossary appears.

-   Type the citation form to filter the list.
-   If on the list, select the entry.

    Paratext fills in the citation form and definition fields automatically using the information from the entry in the glossary.

### Glossary (GLO) book

-   Click the book dropdown arrow and select Glossary (GLO).

    All of the project’s glossary entries are listed alphabetically.

-   Scroll down to where the entry should be, and verify if it is there or not.
