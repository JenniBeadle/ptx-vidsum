title: How the Status Boxes Help (3.2d)
---
When a back translation has been marked as complete, and someone subsequently edits and saves the vernacular, the status of the affected verse is changed to outdated. It needs checking.

### If no change is needed

-   Mark the verse as finished.

### To move between verses which need checking

-   Use the up and down arrow buttons at the top of the window.

### To see exactly what has changed in the translation

-   Click the ‘**view differences**’ button
    *The Compare Versions window opens*.

On the **left** is the **current** version, and on the **right** is **how it was** when the back translation was marked as finished. The differences between the versions are highlighted.

### Other icons

**X** and **!** indicate a problem with the verse numbering.

-   Hover the mouse over the status box to find out what the symbol means.
-   If the problem is due to an error in the vernacular translation, edit the vernacular to correct the problem.
-   Save it  
    *the checkmark reappears in the back translation*.
