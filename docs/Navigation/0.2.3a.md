title: Scroll group (0.2.3a)
---
Scroll groups allow you to look up a different reference without having all the windows scroll to the new reference,

Paratext allows up to five different scroll groups, A through E. In addition, we can choose “none.”

The small dropdown control which contains the letter A is how we control the scroll groups.

### Change scroll group

-   Click to activate the window
-   Click the scroll group on the toolbar
-   Choose the desired scroll group

-   

    Small letters are shown next to the project abbreviations on the window title bars when the windows are not all in group A.

    When you open a new window, it will be in the same scroll group as the last active one.
