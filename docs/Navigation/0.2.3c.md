title:  Swap text in a window (0.2.3c)
---
You can change which text a window displays. This is a way of opening a different text instead of one of your open ones, leaving your window layout the same.

-   On the toolbar, click the project list.

-   Select the text you wish to display.  
    *The window now shows the new version instead and the window layout remains the same*.

:::note
At this time, you can only open another similar resource in the window using the project list (i.e Project, Enhance Resource, Biblical terms).

:::tip
Remember if the saved layout contains the other version, it will be re-opened if you use the saved layout again.  If the **current text** selection is what you want to use in future, **re-save the layout** as it currently is.
