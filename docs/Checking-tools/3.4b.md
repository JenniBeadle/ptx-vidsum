-   Open the **menu** for the project.
-   Expand the menu.
-   Under **Project Settings** click **Quotation Rules**.

See the example at the bottom of the dialog box to see the three levels of quotes.

1.  Quotes
2.  quotes within quotes, and
3.  quotes within quotes within quotes.

In addition to opening and closing quotation marks, there is a continuer quotation mark.
