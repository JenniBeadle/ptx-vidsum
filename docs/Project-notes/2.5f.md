title: Search and use Hashtags (2.5f)
---
In this video, we are going to see how to search in the Notes List to find notes.

-   Click in the search box
-   Start typing

    As you type, matching notes will be shown in the list.

A note matches if the search text is found in

-   the original note,
-   any of its comments,
-   the names of team members
-   the Scripture text which this note is attached to.

#### Add hashtags to your notes

A hashtag is a typed tag which begins with the hash symbol (or pound sign). Notes can have multiple hashtags.

### Add hashtag

-   Type a \# and a tag anywhere in a note

### Search for hashtag

-   In the filter, type the hash symbol in the search box and then continue to type the rest of the tag.

    The search implements a filter straightaway and as you continue to type it gets narrowed down further.
