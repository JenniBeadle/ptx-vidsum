Project Notes make it easy to communicate with your translation team or translation consultant, or even to make notes for yourself, about day-to-day translation questions, but they are not published.

In this video we will see how to insert notes, choose which part of the verse the note is about, and who it is assigned to, if anyone. We will also learn how to open a previously added note to read it.
